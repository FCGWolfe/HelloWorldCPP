# HelloWorldCPP
My first "Hello World" program written in C++. Fuck this cryptic language, this shit makes C# look like plain english.

Purpose: none. this is fucking useless to you.

Usage: run HelloWorldCPP.exe from command prompt and answer the question.

Known issues: The name check gets skipped, presumably because I don't know how "getline" works and fucked it up somehow.
